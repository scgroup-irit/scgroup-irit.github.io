        <h3 id="Martin">Nadine Martin</h3>
        <p>
        Nadine Martin is a Research Director in the LIS (Laboratoire des Images et des Signaux) at INPG (Institut National Polytechnique de Grenoble), in Grenoble, France. In 1996, she has initiated a research and industrial project, within the frame of the GDR-PRC-ISIS . In his first phase, the project was called ASPECT (Analyse SPECTrale) and aimed at creating a spectral analysis tool, as an help for analyzing and interpretating various signals coming from various application domains (acoustics, mechanics, telecommunication). The innovative idea under the ASPECT project is not to use one single spectral analysis method but rather to use several of them in a spiral, leading to better and deeper analysis of the signal of interest.<br/><br/>

        Since the beginning of the project, Corinne Mailhes from the SC group is involved in the ASPECT project as a spectral analysis expert. A Ph.D. thesis has been done around the ASPECT project, with Nadine Martin and Corinne Mailhes as co-PhD advisors. Within the frame of this PhD and the project ASPECT, two papers were presented in the GRETSI 97 and a book is under redaction at Eyrolles Editions.<br/><br/>

        After the success of the ASPECT project, it has evaluated in a second phase in which the actors are looking at an automatization of the spectral analysis spiral : the TeTRAS project. In this phase, the SC group is always present as a spectral analysis partner.

        <h3 id="Ferrari">Andr&eacute; Ferrari</h3>
        <p>
        Andr&eacute; Ferrari is professor at the university of Nice Sophia Antipolis. He has been working in collaboration with Jean-Yves Tourneret on many signal processing activities including :<br/>
            -  Spectral Estimation of Signals subjected to Jitter. This study has been published in the international conference on signal processing (ICASSP97) and in the IEEE workshop on higher order statistics in Banff in 1997.<br/>
            -  Application of signal processing algorithms for the detection and estimation of signal with application to astrophysics. This work has been published in the international journal "signal processing" in April 2002 and in many conferences such as the international conference on signal processing in 1999 (ICASSP 99) and 2002 (ICASSP 02) and the European EURASIP conference on signal processing (EUSIPCO 02).<br/>

        Andr&eacute; Ferrari has also worked on various statistical signal processing problems including the determination of Cramer-Rao lower bounds for changepoints which has been published in the international conference on signal processing in 2002 (ICASSP 02).

        <h3 id="Letac">G&eacute;rard Letac</h3>
         <p>
         G&eacute;rard Letac is professor at the Laboratoire de Probabilites et Statistique at the University of Toulouse (France). He has been working in collaboration with Jean-Yves Tourneret on the modeling and detection of photometric signals by using correlated Poisson distributions. These problems have been applied to the detection of extra-solar planets and has been published in the international conference on signal processing in 2002 (ICASSP'02).
         </p>

        <h3 id="Davy">Manuel Davy and Christian Doncarli</h3>
         <p>Manuel Davy and Christian Doncarli were respectively CNRS researcher and professor in the laboratory IRCCyN in Ecole Centrale de Nantes (France). They worked in collaboration with Jean-Yves Tourneret on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods applied to the classification of non-stationary signals such as chirp signals. As a result of this collaboration, a paper has been published in the IEEE Trans. Signal Processing (February 2002) as well as two papers in the international conference on signal processing in 2000 (ICASSP'00) and 2002 (ICASSP'02).
         </p>

        <h3 id="Aubert">Herv&eacute; Aubert</h3>
        <p>
        Herv&eacute; Aubert is professor at the laboratory of Electronics (LEN7) of the university ENSEEIHT in Toulouse (France). He has been working in collaboration with Jean-Yves Tourneret on  the application of the wavelet transform for electromagnetic inverse problems implying fractal objects. Signal processing tools have been used to study the robustness of the extraction algorithms to the presence of noise. Such analysis has for instance been published in the Progress in Electromagnetics Research Symposium (PIERS 2002) in Cambridge (Massachusetts, USA) in July 2002.
        </p>

        <h3 id="Doisy">Michel Doisy</h3>
        <p>
        Michel Doisy is assistant professor in the laboratory of probability and statistics (LSP) of the university of Toulouse. He has worked in collaboration with Martial Coulon and Jean-Yves Tourneret on change-point detection algorithms based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. This collaboration has led to the publication of in the European journal on signal processing (whose editor is Murat Kunt) in may 2003. He was the PHD advisor of S. Suparman who worked on reversible jump MCMC methods applied to change-point detection. This study has led to the publication of papers in conferences such as the international conference on signal processing in 1998 (ICASSP 98), 2002 (ICASSP 02) and 2003 (ICASSP 03), the workshop on statistical models and methods for discontinuous phenomena in Oslo in may 1998 and the workshop on higher order statistics in Caesarea (Israel) in june 1999. He is also conducting several teaching activities in the school ENSEEIHT in collaboration with faculty members such as Marie Chabert, Martial Coulon and Jean-Yves Tourneret.
        </p>

        <h3 id="Lavielle">Marc Lavielle</h3>
        <p>
        Marc Lavielle is professor at the university of Paris Sud in Orsay. He has worked in collaboration with Michel Doisy and Jean-Yves Tourneret on change-point detection algorithms with an application to synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image segmentation. As a result of this cooperation, the authors have published a paper in the European journal on signal processing (whose editor is Murat Kunt) in may 2003.
